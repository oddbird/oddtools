OddTools
========

Development
-----------

If you want to run this project in a `virtualenv`_ to isolate it from
other Python projects on your system, create a virtualenv and activate
it.  Then run ``bin/install-reqs`` to install the dependencies for
this project into your Python environment.

You'll probably need to create a ``src/oddtools/settings/local.py`` file
with some details of your local configuration, including, most likely,
your database details (SQLite will be used by default).  See
``src/oddtools/settings_local.sample.py`` for a sample that can be
copied to ``src/oddtools/settings_local.py`` and modified.

Once this configuration is done, you should be able to run
``./manage.py syncdb --migrate``, then ``./manage.py runserver`` and
access the site in your browser at ``http://localhost:8000``.

To install the necessary Ruby gems for Compass/Sass development, run
``bin/install-gems``.  Update ``requirements/gems.txt`` if newer gems
should be used.

Deployment
----------

In addition to the above configuration, in any production deployment
this entire app should be served exclusively over HTTPS (since serving
authenticated pages over HTTP invites session hijacking
attacks). Ideally, the non-HTTP URLs should redirect to the HTTPS
version.

``src/oddtools/settings/prod.py`` should be used as the settings module in a
production deployment in place of ``src/oddtools/settings/default.py`` (set
``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=oddtools.settings.prod``). Site-specific overrides
can still be placed in ``src/oddtools/settings/local.py``.

You can run ``./manage.py checksecure`` to verify that settings are correctly
configured for a secure deployment.

This app also uses the `staticfiles contrib app`_ in Django 1.3 for
collecting static assets from reusable components into a single
directory for production serving.  Under "runserver" in development
this is handled automatically.  In production, run ``./manage.py
collectstatic`` to collect all static assets into the
``collected-assets`` directory (or whatever ``STATIC_ROOT`` is set to
in ``settings_local.py``), and make those collected assets available
by HTTP at the ``STATIC_URL`` setting.
